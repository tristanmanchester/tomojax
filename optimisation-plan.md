### Section 1: Add Scan Unroll Knob to Forward Projector (projector_parallel_jax.py)
**Where:** In the `forward_project_view` function signature and `jax.lax.scan` call.  
**What:** Add a new parameter `scan_unroll: int | bool = 1` to the function signature (make it static for jit). In the scan body, change `jax.lax.scan(step_fn, acc0, ys)` to `jax.lax.scan(step_fn, acc0, ys, unroll=scan_unroll)`. Pass this parameter to callers (e.g., from builders) with defaults like 4 on GPU or 1 on CPU.  
**Why:** Enables better kernel fusion and reduces launch overhead on GPU (up to 2x speedup for y-integration loops), while controlling memory growth. JAX docs recommend unroll for small iteration counts; mitigates known memory jumps when rolling from 1 to 2+ steps, improving throughput without exceeding HBM limits.

### Section 2: Cache Detector Grid and Y-Samples as Constants (projector_parallel_jax.py)
**Where:** At the top of the file, after imports; replace calls in `forward_project_view`.  
**What:** Add two `@lru_cache(maxsize=128)` functions: one for `build_detector_grid` (cache Xr, Zr by nu/nv/du/dv/det_center args) and one for `cached_y_samples` (cache ys by n_steps/y0/step_size). In `forward_project_view`, replace direct computations with calls to these (e.g., `Xr, Zr = build_detector_grid(int(nu), int(nv), float(du), float(dv), float(det_center[0]), float(det_center[1]))` and `ys = cached_y_samples(int(n_steps), float(y0), float(step_size))`).  
**Why:** Avoids redundant array allocations and computations per call (saves ~10-20% time in repeated projections), as these are geometry constants under jit. LRU caching on CPU side ensures they become fused constants in XLA, reducing memory bandwidth and compilation time.

### Section 3: Unify Angles-Only Loss/Grad to Scan-Based Builder (New file: loss_builders.py or integrate into optimization_steps.py)
**Where:** Create a new function `build_loss_and_grad_angles_scan` (mirror your existing `build_aligned_loss_and_grad_scan`).  
**What:** Define the function to take projections/angles/geometry args, build a scan over views (like your aligned version: body computes forward_project_view with params=[0,0,phi_i,0,0], accumulates 0.5 * vdot(r,r)). Jit with `jax.jit(jax.value_and_grad(loss_fn))`. In your CLI script or fista_tv_reconstruction (non-aligned path), replace `data_f_grad_vjp` calls with this builder.  
**Why:** Eliminates Python loop overhead and per-view VJP (up to 5x faster gradient computation for 100+ views), unifying with your aligned path for maintainability. Leverages scan's efficient lowering to XLA WhileOp, reducing host-device transfers and enabling better fusion.

### Section 4: Scope Matmul Precision to Context Manager (New helper in optimization_steps.py or CLI script)
**Where:** Add a context manager at the top of optimization_steps.py; wrap hot calls in FISTA loops or builders.  
**What:** Define `@contextmanager def matmul_precision(level: str = "medium"):` using `with jax.default_matmul_precision(level): yield`. Wrap gradient steps like `with matmul_precision("medium"): fval, grad = loss_and_grad(zk)`. Add a flag (e.g., CLI arg) to toggle "high" for validation.  
**Why:** Enables tensor-core acceleration on GPU (10-30% speedup for rotation matrices and projections without accuracy loss in float32), scoped to avoid global side effects. JAX recommends this for perf tuning; benchmark to confirm no numerical drift in CT artifacts.

### Section 5: Expand Donate_Argnums in FISTA Step (optimization_steps.py, in fista_tv_reconstruction or solver class)
**Where:** In the FISTA iteration loop or as a jitted step factory.  
**What:** Wrap the iteration body in `@jax.jit(donate_argnums=(0,1)) def step(xk, xk_prev, tk):` (donate xk/xk_prev; compute zk, grad, yk, prox, return x_next, xk (old), t_next, fval, grad_norm). Call iteratively with `xk, xk_prev, tk, fval, grad_norm = step(xk, xk_prev, tk)`.  
**Why:** Allows XLA to reuse input buffers for outputs, cutting peak memory by 20-50% in large volumes (e.g., 128^3), especially during grad computation. JAX best practices emphasize donation for iterative algos like FISTA to minimize allocations without changing semantics.

### Section 6: Add Early Stopping with Patience Window (optimization_steps.py, in fista_tv_reconstruction loop)
**Where:** Inside the FISTA for-loop, after computing fval/grad_norm.  
**What:** Add vars: `patience=5, tol_grad=1e-5, tol_rel=1e-5, best_f=float('inf'), no_improve=0`. After append to objective_history: if fval < best_f: best_f=fval; no_improve=0 else: no_improve+=1. If len(history)>patience and grad_norm<tol_grad and rel_change (over last patience steps)<tol_rel and no_improve>=patience: break with print.  
**Why:** Prevents unnecessary iterations on converged solutions (saves 20-50% runtime for well-conditioned problems), using smoothed metrics to avoid noise. Improves efficiency without risking under-optimization, as CT convergence is often monotonic.

### Section 7: Device-Aware Builder and Batch Sizing (optimization_steps.py, in build_ultrafast_loss_and_grad_scan and solver init)
**Where:** At the top of build_ultrafast... and in solver's solve_adaptive.  
**What:** Detect `platform = jax.devices()[0].platform`. In builder: if platform=='gpu': batch_size = min(max(batch_size,8),32,len(params)) else: batch_size=min(batch_size,8). In solver: if platform=='gpu' and n_views>32: use ultrafast batched else: use scan builder (aligned or angles).  
**Why:** Optimizes for hardware: larger batches leverage GPU parallelism (2-3x throughput), while smaller scans prevent OOM on CPU/TPU. Matches JAX scaling patterns, reducing memory spikes and improving wall-clock time by 30-50% on accelerators.

### Section 8: Add Profiling and Memory Analysis Helpers (New helpers in optimization_steps.py)
**Where:** Add two functions at module level; call in validation or benchmark.  
**What:** Def `def analyze_memory(fun, *args): lowered=fun.lower(*args); compiled=lowered.compile(); print(compiled.memory_analysis()); return compiled`. Def `def profile_block(tag, fn, *args): with jax.profiler.trace(f"/tmp/jax-{tag}", create_perfetto_link=True): out=fn(*args); jax.block_until_ready(out); return out`. Use e.g., `analyze_memory(forward_project_view, ...)` and `profile_block('fista_iter', step, xk,...)`.  
**Why:** Quantifies temp memory and kernel fusion (spot scan unroll benefits), with Perfetto traces for GPU timeline analysis (identifies bottlenecks like HBM traffic). JAX profiler docs recommend this for iterative algos; enables data-driven tuning without guesswork.

### Section 9: Standardize Lipschitz on Scan-Based AtA (optimization_steps.py, in estimate_L_power and LipschitzEstimator)
**Where:** In estimate_L_power (legacy) and estimator's estimate_incremental.  
**What:** Replace VJP loops with calls to your existing `build_AtA_scan` (zeros projections) and power method on it. In estimator: default to method="scan" using AtA operator; fallback to adaptive/randomized only if n_views>1000. Remove deprecated estimate_L_power_aligned.  
**Why:** Leverages efficient scan lowering (2-4x faster than per-view VJPs for L estimation), unifying paths and reducing code duplication. Improves accuracy/stability for large view counts by avoiding loop overhead, aligning with your optimized projector.

### Section 10: Optional Pallas Kernel for Trilinear Gather (projector_parallel_jax.py, behind flag)
**Where:** Add a new `trilinear_gather_pallas` function; gate in `trilinear_gather`.  
**What:** If `use_pallas=False` (default): keep existing. Else (GPU only): implement pl.pallas_call kernel loading indices, clipping, flat-indexing recon_flat, blending 8 corners, writing to out_ref. In forward_project_view: if use_pallas and platform=='gpu': use_pallas version else original. Add CLI flag to enable.  
**Why:** Can fuse gather better on GPU Triton backend (potential 1.5-2x speedup for dense sampling), but experimental—benchmark first. JAX Pallas docs note it's for custom kernels; fallback ensures compatibility, with flag for opt-in after validation.

### Section 11: Benchmark Harness for Sweeps (New file: benchmark.py)
**Where:** Create standalone script importing your solver/builders.  
**What:** Def `sweep_configs(configs, build_fn, step_fn)`: for each cfg (dicts with scan_unroll=[1,2,4,8], batch_size=[8,16,32], checkpoint=[True,False]): build loss_and_grad, make step, warmup jit, time 10 iters, call analyze_memory/profile_block, collect (time, temp_mem, objective). Sort/print best. Run with dummy small data (e.g., 32^3 vol, 16 views).  
**Why:** Systematically tunes unroll/batch/checkpoint (e.g., find optimal for your hardware, saving 20-40% time), with memory metrics to avoid OOM. Enables before/after comparisons; JAX recommends this for config sweeps in scientific compute.

### Implementation Notes
- **Order:** Start with Sections 1-3 (projector and builders) for core perf gains, then 4-6 (FISTA tweaks), 7-9 (awareness/unification), and 10-11 (optional/experimental). Test numerically after each (e.g., adjoint test unchanged).
- **Defaults:** Use scan_unroll=4 on GPU/1 on CPU; batch_size=16 on GPU/4 on CPU; keep float32 everywhere.
- **Validation:** After changes, run your existing adjoint_test_once and validate_optimizations; add NaN/Inf checks in loops (e.g., `if jnp.isnan(fval): print("NaN detected")`).
- **Multi-Device (Bonus, if >1 GPU):** In solvers, add optional sharding: use `jax.sharding.NamedSharding(mesh, P("devices", None, None))` on x_flat (shard along x-dim); let jit propagate. Why: Scales linearly to 4-8 GPUs for large volumes (2-4x speedup), per JAX sharding docs—test with shard_map for explicit psum if needed.
- **Expected Gains:** 2-5x faster gradients, 20-40% less memory, 30% shorter FISTA runtime overall; benchmark to confirm on your data/hardware.
