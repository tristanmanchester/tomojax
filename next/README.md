% TomoJAX v2 Workspace (next/)

This folder is a clean, non-destructive workspace for the cohesive v2 of TomoJAX. It will coexist with the current codebase while we iterate on a clearer structure, stable APIs, HDF5/NXtomo IO, geometry abstraction (parallel CT and laminography), reproducible CLIs, and robust tests. No existing files are modified by v2 work.

See `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` in this folder for the step‑by‑step plan.
