# TomoJAX Execution Plans

`docs/tomojax-v2/04_phased_implementation_plan.md` is the canonical phased plan.
This file is the living execution plan for the active milestone only.

Update this file before starting a milestone, keep it current while working, and
summarise outcomes in `docs/implementation_log.md` before moving on.

## Active Milestone

### Canonical Phase

- Source plan: `docs/tomojax-v2/04_phased_implementation_plan.md`
- Phase: Synthetic benchmark foundation / Phase 7 smoke artifacts
- Goal: align the Phase 7 smoke verification report with the artifact
  contract's top-level shape.

### Scope

- In scope:
  - Add `status`, `summary`, `metrics`, and `escalation` sections to
    `verification.json`.
  - Keep existing smoke-specific fields for deterministic tests and audit.
  - Extend focused smoke and artifact-validation tests.
- Out of scope:
  - Further legacy Ruff cleanup.
  - GPU/Pallas fast paths.
  - Full production dataset loading through the new command.
- Deep module owner: `tomojax.align`.

### Design Sources

- `docs/tomojax-v2/01_high_level_architecture.md`
- `docs/tomojax-v2/04_phased_implementation_plan.md`
- `docs/tomojax-v2/06_verification_and_artifact_contract.md`

### Tasks

- [x] Add contract-shaped verification sections.
- [x] Extend smoke and validator tests.
- [x] Run focused validation and `just imports`.
- [x] Update `docs/implementation_log.md`.
- [x] Commit the verification report contract slice.

### Validation

- `uv run ruff format src/tomojax/align/_alternating.py src/tomojax/verify/_artifacts.py tests/test_alternating_solver_smoke.py tests/test_verify_artifacts.py`
  passed.
- `uv run ruff check src/tomojax/align/_alternating.py src/tomojax/verify/_artifacts.py tests/test_alternating_solver_smoke.py tests/test_verify_artifacts.py`
  passed.
- `uv run basedpyright src/tomojax/align/_alternating.py src/tomojax/verify/_artifacts.py tests/test_alternating_solver_smoke.py tests/test_verify_artifacts.py`
  passed.
- `uv run pytest tests/test_alternating_solver_smoke.py tests/test_verify_artifacts.py tests/test_align_auto_cli.py -q`
  passed: 8 tests.
- `just imports` passed.

If `just check` cannot pass, record the exact failing command, current failure,
and proposed next fix before stopping.

### Decisions And Deviations

- Preserve existing smoke-specific keys while adding the contract-shaped
  sections so downstream tests and scripts do not lose detailed diagnostics.

### Risks

- Risk: some summary predicates are smoke-level approximations.
- Mitigation: expose them under explicit names and refine them as the
  optimiser gains real held-out residual checks and weak-DOF handling.
